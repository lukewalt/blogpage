			<h3>New Solar, Wind Competitive Leasing Program to Start for US Public Lands</h3>
				<p>U.S. Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewell on Nov. 10 said that the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has finalized a rule that creates a new competitive leasing process and incentives for solar and wind energy development on public lands.</p>

			<h3>Alberta Advances Clean Energy Goals with More Renewables</h3>
				<p>The Canadian Wind Energy Association (CanWEA) said Nov. 3 that a provincial leader in Alberta made a major policy pronouncement at the final day of the association's 32nd Annual Conference and Exhibition in Calgary.
	Alberta Minister of Environment and Parks and the Minister Responsible for the Climate Change Office, Shannon Phillips, speaking in front of a packed plenary room at CanWEA 2016, announced that the Alberta government is introducing the Renewable Electricity Act to legislate its target of 30 percent renewable electricity by 2030. Phillips also announced that Alberta will be proceeding with a procurement of an initial 400 MW of renewable energy as a first step towards meeting the target.</p>

			<h3>Renewable Energy: Americans Are Optimistic, But Not Quite Right</h3>
				<p>Not as much as they think they do, according to a Makovsky survey of more than 1,000 residents across the U.S.
		Turns out that Americans are a bit overly optimistic about the role that renewable energy plays in the U.S. The average American believes that 20 percent of the country’s energy use comes from renewables—11 percent from solar and 9 percent from wind.
		The reality is quite different. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), solar is at 1 percent and wind is at 2 percent.</p>

			<h3>The States’ Role in Providing Solar Information to Consumers</h3>
				<p>State governments have an increasingly important obligation and opportunity to present the public with sound, unbiased, user-friendly information on solar energy systems and financing options. With hundreds of thousands of solar photovoltaic (PV) systems being installed at homes, businesses, and institutions, consumers need help to ensure that they make decisions that give them long-lasting satisfaction rather than regrets.
	The need for consumer information from states is greater for solar systems than for more traditional large purchases. The solar industry is relatively new and does not have well-established brands, easily accessible product review websites, or industry-specific consumer protection laws, such as automobile “lemon laws” and standardized disclosure forms for car leases.</p>

			<h3>Working Smarter, Not Harder: How Companies Are Setting New Energy Goals</h3>
				<p>A great example of goals driving smart and strategic action in buildings is our recent work in New York City. Over the summer, more than 25 fellows worked within companies, city agencies, and even a local utility to design strategic plans to help meet Mayor de Blasio’s ambitious 80 x 50 goal that pledges to reduce city greenhouse gas emissions 80 percent by 2050. Rather than approach this one boiler room at a time, our fellows worked on ambitious, portfolio-wide equipment replacement and onsite renewable energy plans, with the potential to impact thousands of buildings at once. It’s great to see a municipal goal drive strategy from both the public and the private sector. The mayor’s goals are clearly spurring action, and large-scale strategy is the way to drive rapid improvements that could take much longer through an incremental approach.</p>
